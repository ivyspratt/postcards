Sending out postcards during voting periods has been a method used by political figures for decades. We use data from a 2006 experiment in Michigan to help us figure out the effect that sending these postcards have on the probability that the voters will vote, applying it to a current day governor election in Texas. We recognize that using data from Michigan and applying it to Texas may not be completely representative. We fit a logistic regression model predicting voter turnout as a function of postcard treatment, voter engagement, age, and sex.
